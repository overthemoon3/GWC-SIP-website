        Disposing protocols vary in every country, every locality even.
        At times, separating trash between paper and plastic can be time-consuming. But it's nothing compared to the recycling efforts of residents in Kamikatsu, a small village in southwestern Japan.
      They sort their garbage into 34 separate categories of waste. This was implemented in 2003. It took time for residents to adjust to the tedious task of washing, sorting, and bringing their trash to the town's sorting center but now it's routine.

        <li class="action-li">Take care when selecting your fabrics.</li>
        <li class="action-li">Eat less red meat (or meat in general but that's an argument for another time)   :)  .</li>
        <li class="action-li">Reuse items and buy second-hand whenever you can: peruse to flea markets, borrow from friends and family, shop on online marketplaces and try to fix broken goods rather than buying new.</li>
        <li class="action-li">Eliminate the use of single-use plastics and use reusable cups, utensils, bags, and containers instead. </li>
        <li class="action-li">Limit air travel and get around by using rideshare, biking, taking the train and public transport and if possible, drive electric vehicles.</li>
        <li class="action-li">Nurture a sense of caring for all things.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Companies understand that being ethical is in vogue so their marketing messaging touts sustainability and ethical practices. While that may be a sign of the prevailing conscious consumer (woo!), it’s always good to look a little deeper to make sure companies are actually taking action consistent with what they’re promoting.
